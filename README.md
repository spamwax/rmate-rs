# rmate â™¥ Rust

fast, reliable implementation of **rmate** in Rust.

Pre-complied binaries for multiple platforms are available in [Releases page](https://github.com/azhinu/rmate-rust/releases).

### Features

- Support all options and rmate.rc settings described in [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/textmate/rmate).
- Create backups of local files to avoid corrupting your files if any io/network operations go wrong.
- Verbose logging of operation (use `-v` one or more times). See [![the screencat](https://asciinema.org/a/fqgvpm9yPdDFAZ11f8uY1DF26.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/fqgvpm9yPdDFAZ11f8uY1DF26).

### Build from sources

You can build **rmate-rs** with docker using `build.sh` script. Just run:
```shell
./build.sh <os target you need>
```

*:information_source: tested only with `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` targets.*
